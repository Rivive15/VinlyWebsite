    "vinylname": "The New Abnormal - The Strokes",
    "vinyldescription": String.raw`The New Abnormal is the sixth studio album by American rock band the Strokes, released on April 10, 2020, through Cult and RCA Records. 
    It was their first full-length album since Comedown Machine (2013), marking the longest gap between studio albums by the band. 
    The album was produced by Rick Rubin and recorded at his Shangri-La studio in Malibu, California, with additional recording taking place at studios in Los Angeles County and Hawaii. 
    The Strokes began performing songs from the album for the first time throughout 2019 before revealing the album's track list and cover art in early 2020. 
    "At the Door", "Bad Decisions", and "Brooklyn Bridge to Chorus" were released as singles prior to the album's release, with "The Adults Are Talking" being released to radio months later.
    The New Abnormal received very positive reviews from critics, many of whom considered it a return to form for the band. 
    Praise was directed particularly towards the maturity of singer Julian Casablancas' lyrics as well as the band's improved sense of musical cohesion. 
    The album reached No. 1 in Scotland and the top ten in six other countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. 
    It also won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2021, the band's first nomination and win.`,

Highlights aplenty then - fan favourite Machu Pichu rubs shoulders with killer singles Taken for A Fool and Under Cover Of Darkness but there's so much to love about this record it's almost churlish to pick out highlights.`,

    "vinylname": "Room On Fire - The Strokes",
    "vinyldescription": `The Strokes second full-length release was an album that won't cause the stir that its predecessor did, but has a sneaky appeal all its own. Thanks to the quintet's Lower East Side roots, Velvet Underground and Television references abound with these guys, but Boston new wavers the Cars, and in particular their hit-heavy second album, 1979's Candy-O, provide a more suitable point of reference for Room On Fire.As with Ric Ocasek and company, Strokes frontman Julian Casablancas and his cohorts have a Cars-like knack for sly riffs that creep deeper into ones consciousness with each listen. Not much longer than a half hour from start to finish, this 11-song is modest in intent and execution, and succeeds quite nicely on its own terms.The album features the return of producer Gordon Raphael from 'Is This It' and consists of a slightly smoother sound than its predecessor. Three singles were released from the album; '12:51', 'Reptilia' and 'The End Has No End'.`,

Butler says it's the first time the band had a proper, top-to-bottom studio experience, which meant no cutting corners, and an ability to chase a previously-unattainable level of polish. Tyler Povanda (Save Face) and Kory Gregory (Prince Daddy & the Hyena) contributed vocals to the record. The music on Sweet Tooth marked a departure for Butler from his usual writing style. "I fell in love with bands like Modern Baseball and Front Bottoms and Joyce Manor, so I wanted to write songs like that," says Butler. "That's what our first two records were: me trying to stay in that box, cause I think that's where I felt comfortable." Sweet Tooth feels like an eternal dessert-before-dinner, a rejection of the idea that we need to suffer before we get to the good stuff. You've got one life. Indulge your Sweet Tooth. `,

The DIY touring route quickly had to fall by the wayside, as 200, sometimes 300, kids were showing up to house shows in basements across the country. Often, the band wouldn’t make it through more than a few songs before police had to come shut it down. Now, you can find them in venues of increasing size around the states, as one of the most sought after acts in their genre. On a constant stream of buzz, pressing after pressing of their debut hit Best Buds (2016) has sold out and the fans cannot get enough of the music they have been putting out. Music that takes influence from predecessors such as Modern Baseball and The Front Bottoms, but adds that new flavor that sets them into a league of their own, The Mom Jeans. craze is just beginning.`,
